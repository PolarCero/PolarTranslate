## ðŸš€ Run from Source Code

Follow these steps if you want to clone the repository and run the application directly from the source code on your machine.

ðŸ‘‰ For detailed instructions on how to set up your environment, install dependencies, and run the application from source code, check out our [**Complete Guide to Running from Source Code**](docs/RUNNING_FROM_SOURCE.md).

---

## ðŸ“¦ Use the Executable (Release)

If you just want to use the application without installing Python or managing dependencies, **download the pre-compiled executable** from the GitHub *Releases*.

### 1. Download the Executable

- Go to the repository's Releases page:
Â  [https://github.com/PolarCero/PolarTranslate/releases](https://github.com/PolarCero/PolarTranslate/releases)
Â  *(Replace PolarCero/PolarTranslate with your actual repository path if different).*
- Find the latest Release (e.g., `v0.1.0`).
- In the **"Assets"** section of the Release, download the `PolarTranslate.exe` file.

### 2. Save the Executable

Save the `PolarTranslate.exe` file to a folder of your choice on your computer (e.g., in your Downloads folder or create a specific folder for the application).

### 3. Install Tesseract-OCR (required for OCR features)

This step is the same as for running from source code and is **MANDATORY** for OCR features.

- Download the Tesseract OCR installer from the official website:
Â  [https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/)
- Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
- Make sure the `tesseract` executable is in your system's **PATH**.

### 4. Run the Application

Simply double-click the `PolarTranslate.exe` file you downloaded.

> **Note on Language Packages:**
> Argos Translate language packages are managed directly from the **Configuration** window within the application.
> The first time you run it, you might only have the base languages installed.
> Go to `Configuration -> Languages and Packages` to install the languages you need.
> The application will ask you to close and reopen it after installing/uninstalling packages for the changes to take effect.
